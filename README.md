# Android Assignment
######  We have an interview, yay

### TL;DR

Clone this project, open it in Android Studio and build it.

#### What is this?

This app shows a list of the top three scoring football players in different leagues.

#### What do I do with this?

- Clone it
- Open it in Android Studio
- Let it download its dependencies
- Make the project once (since we have some intermediate classes which need to be generated)
- Chill :)

#### üìù Task Description
In this task, you are expected to design and implement an Android application that displays football player data for all leagues and players provided.

Core Requirements:
1. Display a list of players
- Player data must be displayed using pagination.
- Sorting should be applied across the entire dataset, not just the current page.
- The method of implementing pagination and sorting ‚Äî and how they interact ‚Äî is completely up to you.

2. Follow / Unfollow players
- The user must be able to follow or unfollow any player.
- Followed players should be persisted locally, so the follow status remains after closing and reopening the app.
- How you model and store this state is entirely your decision.

3. Followed players screen
- The user must be able to view their followed players in a dedicated screen.
- How this screen is accessed is also up to you (e.g. a button on the main screen, or a tab in bottom navigation).



#### üîß Technical Requirements
The following are mandatory and will be strictly evaluated:

Use Jetpack Compose for UI.

Follow Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of layers (Presentation / Domain / Data).

Implement Unit Tests for key components.

Implement UI Tests for important user flows.

Additional technical decisions ‚Äî including state management, navigation, persistence, dependency injection, design system, etc. ‚Äî are entirely up to you.

Final UI/UX design is also open to your judgment and will be evaluated based on your analysis and decisions.



#### üìå Evaluation Criteria
This task is not just about the final result ‚Äî we're primarily evaluating your approach and thought process:

- Accurate understanding and coverage of the requirements
- Scalable and flexible architectural design
- Clean and maintainable code structure
- Proper state and data flow management
- Code readability and modularity
- Smooth, intuitive, and consistent user experience
- Effective persistence and handling of follow state
- Meaningful test coverage (both Unit and UI)
- Quality of documentation and clarity of technical decisions
