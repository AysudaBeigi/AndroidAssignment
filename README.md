# Android Live Coding Interview
######  We have an interview, yay

### TL;DR

Clone this project, open it in Android Studio and build it.

#### What is this?

This app shows a list of the top three scoring football players in different leagues.

#### What do I do with this?

- Clone it
- Open it in Android Studio
- Let it download its dependencies
- Make the project once (since we have some intermediate classes which need to be generated)
- Chill :)

#### Requirements

You should refactor the project properly and fix possible bugs or memory leaks with this requirements:

- You need to change the whole project to an extensible project. 
- Choose an architecture you have experience with, such as MVP, MVVM, or MVI.
- Use Hilt as dependency injection in the project.
- Implement the desired logics in the radio buttons section.
- UI performance in a large list must be acceptable.
- Write couple of tests for the view's logic.


#### What's the interview like?

We've tried to make the interview similar to our day-to-day work environment as much as it's
possible. It means that:

- You would have access to Internet, stackoverflow, official documentations, your other code
  bases, ...
- There's no penalty for searching the internet or copy pasting code from other sources. There's
  only a penalty for not succeeding to solve the problem.
- We have not memorized all of the Android's APIs, we do not value memorizing them, and we don't
  expect you to have them memorized. We're developers too.
- Since the interview might take two hours or three, please feel free to have a break during it and
  pour yourself a cup of coffee, play a music in the background or anything else that you would
  do during actual work days. It's just a normal coding session, not a big deal.
